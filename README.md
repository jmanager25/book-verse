# BookVerse

![BookVerse Mockup](docs/images/website_mockup.png)

BookVerse is a website for book lovers. A place where users can share and discover new books and connect with fellow readers. Users can add books, rate them using a 5-star system, write their opinion about the book, save their favorite reads, and engage with the community by commenting and liking on reviews. The website is designed to be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

While browsing is open to all, active participation, such as adding books, writing reviews, requires a user account. BookVerse aims to create a space for literary enthusiasts to share opinions and connect with fellow readers.

## User Experience

When designing this application, the main goal was to make it work well and be easy to understand. I chose to keep things simple and clear. Colors are used to draw attention to important stuff, like buttons or active parts of the navigation bar.

The design focuses on being straightforward, so users can easily find and use the app's features without confusion. I made an effort for it to work smoothly on large screens as well as on mobile devices. So, the design is friendly to different screen sizes.

In a nutshell, the design is about making everything work smoothly, being easy to understand, and looking good without being too complicated. Colors are used to help users, and the design works well on both computers and phones.

## Agile Development 

This project was developed using agile development principles.

I used [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/jmanager25/projects/4/views/1) as an agile tool to manage the project's
progress using agile principles. With GitHub Issues, I created epics and user stories and each user stories included acceptance criterias, 
to determine when that user story was completed successfully. I also defined tasks within the user stories, defining specific actions i needed
to take to fulfill the acceptance criteria.

To prioritize the work effectively, I used MOSCOW prioritization. These allowed me to categorize issues into four main groups: 
"must have" features that were critical for the project, "could have" features that were desirable but not essential, 
"should have" features that had moderate importance, and "won't have" features that were intentionally excluded.

To maintain a clear project structure, I linked related issues to their corresponding epics. This provided a high-level view of the project's progress and helped me stay organized throughout the development process.
